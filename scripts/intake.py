"""Publish a submission that arrived as an issue. Stdlib + the gh CLI.

This is the registry's upload door for people who have no fork, no pull
request and no idea what either is: the Personal Jarvis app (and the issue
form on this repo) opens an issue whose body carries the submission as one
fenced JSON code block. This script runs from TRUSTED default-branch code on
the ``issues`` event and turns that issue into a published entry:

1. Read the issue from the event payload. The body is DATA: it is parsed as
   JSON, never executed, never interpolated into a shell.
2. Take the publisher from the issue's AUTHOR — the account GitHub itself
   authenticated to open the issue. Whatever ``publisher`` / ``publisher_id``
   the JSON claims is overwritten, so the identity proof is exactly as strong
   as the fork path's "you opened the pull request yourself".
3. Write ``submissions/<name>.json`` and run scripts/validate.py with the
   pre-change tree as the base, so naming, the secret scan, ownership
   (numeric account id) and the version bump are the same rules every pull
   request meets.
4. On success: commit to main as the bot, start the publish workflow, answer
   on the issue with the install line, label it and close it.
   On failure: answer with the validator's findings and label the issue
   ``needs-changes``; editing the issue runs this again.

No human approves anything (the maintainer's standing decision): the checks
are the gate, and a report after the fact delists.

Environment: GH_TOKEN (contents + issues write), REPO, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH.
``--dry-run`` prints the decision instead of touching git or the issue.
