"""Regression test: every published entry travels with its owner's account id.

A GitHub login is a display name. It can be renamed, and the freed handle can
be registered by somebody else the same day. `publisher` alone therefore cannot
answer "whose work is this?" — a consumer that joins entries to a person by
name hands one account's listings to a stranger the moment a rename happens,
and breaks the original owner's profile page in the same move.

The ownership ledger (registry.json) has keyed on the numeric account id since
the beginning; automerge_gate.py refuses a submission whose id does not match
the pull request author. This test exists because that number used to stop at
the ledger: build_index.py copied `publisher` into the feed and left
`publisher_id` behind, so every downstream consumer was back to matching on a
renameable string.

What it checks, per lane:
- the key is present on every entry, spelled exactly `publisher_id`;
- it is a positive integer, never a string — a JSON consumer comparing 12 to
  "12" gets a silent no-match, which reads as "this person published nothing";
- it agrees with the ledger, so the feed cannot drift from the record that
  decides who may update an entry;
- an entry the ledger has no id for still ships (as null) rather than being
  dropped — the feed's job is to carry what is published, not to withhold an
  entry over a field that predates the field.

Usage:
    python scripts/test_publisher_id.py
